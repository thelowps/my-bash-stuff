## David Lopes, 2012
## A simple script that cleans up the current directory by removing specified files,
## known here as "stains". 

## FEATURES
### -> The GLOBAL_STAINS global variable indicates the default stains that are removed.
####   It is a string of space-separated words. The default is "*~ *.o"
### -> Looks for a local file called .stains and removes those stains too. 
####   This file should also be a list of space-separated file descriptions.

### OPTIONS
### -r (recursive) :
#### cleans all local subdirectories recursively

##  --- TODO ---
### -> implement -v
### -> look for a better way to implement file input into variables other than 'cat'

## SET FLAGS
recursive="no"
hidden="no"
directories="."

## READ FLAGS
if [ "$1" == "-r" ]; then
    recursive='yes'
fi

## RECURSIVE OPTION -- called with the -r flag
if [ $recursive == "yes" ]; then

    for file in *; do 
	if [ -d "$file" ]; then
	    (cd "$file" && clean $@)
	fi
    done

fi

## Runs a makefile clean command, if a makefile exists
if [ -e makefile ] || [ -e Makefile ]; then
    make clean
fi

## Build the stains variable and look for a local .stains file
stains=$GLOBAL_STAINS
if [ -e .stains ]; then
    ## Look up input from file into shell scripts without using cat
    stains=$stains\ "`cat .stains`"
fi

## Remove specified "stain" files. Do not remove directories.
rm -f $stains >&/dev/null
