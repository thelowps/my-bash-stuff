Serim Refactored App Todo:
- "Select Product" label
- Highlight selection in grid views

Ideas:
- Algorithm optimization
-- AVCapture medium quality. Send raw data to SSAColorCardReader (maybe 
   just register it directly as a delegate?). Crop this to a strip ROI,
   bypass UIImage step and go straight to LuminanceSource to do the 
   finder mark detection. Then, if we have found four finder marks, crop
   to QR Code ROI and do the QR Code detection (maybe we can find a way
   to bypass the UIImage step here too, without too much effort). Then,
   if we have a valid QR Code, do the area test, etc.
-- Look into thread priorities?
-- ViewController instantiates SSAColorCardReader, which makes its own
   instance of CaptureSessionManager. ViewController is delegate of SSA.
   SSA continually calls [self.delegate cardReader:self didReadCardWith
   Result:result], where result is a dictionary. There, seems easy enough.

// For the meeting: //
DONE:
- App now has area test (still need experimental values)
- App now has a built-in timer
- App now has live video processing
- App has been massively refactored
--> We are using new features from XCode 4.5 and iOS 5 (ARC, storyboard,
    some new classes).
--> Memory leaks have mostly been dealt with (still need to check)
--> Code is much more maintainable for the next person coming in
- Some UI changes
--> Preferences view is not a full tab anymore
--> Tinkered with some visuals

TODO:
- Add "reset timer" option
- Get values for area test
- User can cancel a test rather than always save it
- Algorithm optimizations
- Database optimizations -- specifically parse requests. Use JSON?
- Use floodfill (not necessary?)
- Revamp wiki
- LOOK INTO SUBSETDATA BUG. "pointer being freed was not allocated". How
  could this be? -- now it's just a segfault... put it on SO
- Fix the Instructions display somehow...

/**-----------------------------------------
PHONE MEETING
- Next target - explosive tests
- Ideas for the current app
-> User downloading the app. Two different customer types: corporation 
   telling its locations to use the app, and 
-> Corporation situation: how do we manage that situation, their account?
   How do we distribute this license?
---> Use a secondary license thing for each company?

-> App user interface:
---> User defined fields, determined at the beginning, will determine the 
     prompt. Predefined fields for each app that get uploaded with the
     parse results. Sort on these user defined fields. User, Location, 
     <variable prompt>. Customized data, pretty much. 
-----> Regular user vs. Super user account?
